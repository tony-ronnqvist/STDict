# STDict a TREAP dictonary
A dictionary is a data-structure that uses keys to associate values, as an example, in this dictionary we can associated the integer 1  with "Hello world". Beacuse this dictionary is built on a TREAP, it's sorted and the built-in methods has a high probability to perform in the average case.

### Timecomplexity


| Algorithm     | Average       | Worst case |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ----------:|
| Space         |   O(n)        |   O(n)     |
| Search        | 	O(log n)    |   O(n)     |
| Insert        | 	O(log n)    |   O(n)     |
| Delete        |  	O(log n)    |   O(n)     |
| sort          | 	O(nlog n)   |   O(n^2)   |
